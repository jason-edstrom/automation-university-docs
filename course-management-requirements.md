### What are some requirements that the university registration system have for course management?

For an effective course management system, the university registration system should have the following requirements:

**1. Course Catalogue:** 
- The system should allow the creation and maintenance of a detailed course catalogue.
- The catalogue should include course details like title, code, description, prerequisites, credit hours, department, instructor, and class schedule.

**2. Course Lifecycle Management:**
- Staff should be able to create, update, and retire courses in the catalogue.
- Courses should be able to be scheduled for different semesters, with a method to set the start and end dates for each course.
- The system should also track and display the history of course modifications.

**3. Course Capacity Control:**
- Each course should have a set limit on the number of students who can enroll.
- Once the limit is reached, the system should automatically create a waitlist.
- As students drop the course, the system should automatically enroll students from the waitlist and notify them.

**4. Prerequisites and Corequisites Management:**
- The system should allow for the setting of course prerequisites and corequisites.
- During registration, it should automatically check whether a student has fulfilled the prerequisites before allowing enrollment.

**5. Class Scheduling:**
- The system should assist in scheduling classes, ensuring there are no conflicts in room and time slots.
- It should take into consideration factors like room capacity, availability of instructors, and so on.

**6. Course Conflict Management:**
- The system should alert students during registration if a chosen course conflicts with another course they are already registered for.

**7. Course Ratings and Feedback:**
- Students should be able to rate and provide feedback on the courses they've completed. This could help other students during their course selection process.
- Staff should be able to view and analyze these ratings and feedback to improve course quality.

**8. Course Material Management:**
- Instructors should be able to upload course materials, such as syllabi, reading materials, and assignments, directly to the system.
- The system should also integrate with the universityâ€™s learning management system, if one exists.

**9. Course Communication:**
- Instructors should be able to send announcements to all students enrolled in a course through the system.
- Students should receive notifications when new announcements are posted.

**10. Data Security and Privacy:**
- The system should ensure the privacy and security of all course data, including materials, grades, and student information.
- Only authorized personnel should be able to modify course details.

These requirements aim to ensure that the course management feature of the university registration system is robust, user-friendly, and efficient, making the course selection and enrollment process easier for students and administrative tasks simpler for staff.
