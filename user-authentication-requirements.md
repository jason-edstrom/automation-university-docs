### What would some specific functionalities that would require for user authentication and authorization?

User authentication and authorization are critical parts of any secure system, including a university registration system. Here are some specific functionalities that would require these processes:

**1. User Authentication:**

- **Login:** Users must provide valid credentials (like username/password or another form of authentication) to access the system. 

- **Password Recovery:** Users should be able to recover or reset their password securely, typically through email or SMS verification.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** For enhanced security, a 2FA process may be implemented. After entering their password, users would need to provide a second factor of authentication, such as a unique code sent to their phone or email.

- **Timeouts and Session Management:** If users are inactive for a certain period of time, the system should automatically log them out. Upon returning, they'll need to re-authenticate to resume their session.

**2. User Authorization:**

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Different types of users (students, faculty, administrators, etc.) should have different levels of access. For example, a student user should be able to view and enroll in courses, but not modify course details, which would be a function for faculty or administrators.

- **Course Registration:** Students should only be allowed to register for courses if they meet the eligibility criteria (e.g., completed prerequisites, no scheduling conflicts, not exceeding maximum credit hours).

- **Data Modification:** Only authorized users should be able to create, modify, or delete data. For instance, only an administrator should be able to create new courses, only faculty should be able to assign grades, and only students should be able to modify their personal contact information.

- **Report Generation:** Certain sensitive reports should only be accessible by authorized personnel.

- **Payment Processing:** Access to payment and billing information should be highly restricted due to its sensitive nature.

- **Administrative Controls:** Higher-level system functions, such as user management, system settings, and data backup, should only be accessible by designated administrators.

In addition to these functionalities, the system should be designed in accordance with best practices for secure development, including measures like encrypting sensitive data, logging and monitoring system activities, and regularly updating and patching the system to protect against vulnerabilities.
